  <p>About:</p>
  <p>This page shows a selection of data from MLB baseball games.  It is currently hardcoded to show results only from Game 2 of the 2014 World Series, but with minor improvements it could easily display data for any MLB game.</p>

  <p>It has two modes.  When a game is in progress, it can be configured to show the current batter and pitcher as the game is in progress, along with the score.  For games that have already finished (like Game 2) it will show the winning and losing pitchers, the score, and if you click on the players it will show a selection of their stats from the game.</p>
